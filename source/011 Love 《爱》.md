Among the more curious questions that can be asked about love is this,when one feels romantic love, does he feel it in breaks with interruptions or changes, or does he feel it continuously without interruption orchange? Poetry and song seduce one into thinking love continues without interruption. “Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds,” wrote Shakespeare in one of his famous sonnets, “love is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken.” he continued. And (Elizabeth Berra Browning) wrote of her constancy to her husband Robert, in such lines is this,"what I do and what I dream include he." Some of the greatest operas also praise the ever-lasting love by some heroes and heroines dying for it.

In reality, love probably goes on with breaks and interruptions. First, it is difficult to suppose that one can experience anything continuously. Sleep interrupts wakefulness, and sleep itself is interrupted by dreams and nightmares.The feeling one has for his lover during wakefulness may be (blooded out) or intensified by sleep, in either case, the feeling changes. When one is awake, he cannot fix his eyes or his attention constantly on a single object, he must blink if nothing else. More likely, he will look to something else for variety or (from neccessity). His mind may turn to the stock market, or he may become fascinated by the operation of a pile driver on his way to work. His focus for much of his day is on work, as he closes the door to his office, his thought may turn to his love, but sitting at his desk, his eyes fix on the print and figures there.

Pain and pleasure, either one (can distract) a love from concentrating on his love. Pain cause everything to itself, one can forget one’s love for a period even over a (stubbed toe). The pleasure of too much food or drink can be totally absorbing. The pleasure, even of one’s lover, may become boring periodically. Often the greatest distraction is oneself.As times, the preoccupation with “self”,the worry over “self”, the development of “self”, the delight in “self” admit no other thought. Lovely as love might be, one can neither live nor love continuously. At best, a lover can only echo the words of the poet, (Ernest Dpwson), and say “I have been faithful to the in-mind fashion.”

你可能会被问及很多有趣的问题，其中关于爱的是：一个人是在爱受阻碍时还是在不受阻碍时感觉到爱是浪漫的？ 诗歌和歌曲可以引诱我们进入爱的遐想之中，一刻不被打扰。“爱算不得真爱，若是一看见人家改变便转舵，”莎士比亚在他一首著名的十四行诗中写道，“爱是亘古长明的塔灯，它定睛望着风暴却兀不为动”。伊丽莎白.巴莱特.白朗宁在表达她对丈夫罗伯特的忠贞不渝时如此写道：“我做的和我想的都有他。”一些伟大的歌剧同样赞扬男女主人公渴望的那种永恒的爱。

现实中，爱总是有所阻碍。首先，很难想象一个人不受阻碍的经历任何事情。睡觉中断了清醒，而睡觉本身也被梦与噩梦所中断。一个人清醒时对爱人的感觉会因睡眠减少或增加，但那感觉都改变了。当一个人醒着时，他不可能持久地盯着或关注着一样东西，至少他要眨眼（如果没有其他事的话）。更可能是他要看别的东西来丰富视野或是基于需求。在去上班的路上，他可能会想着股市或对路边的打桩机着迷。大多数时间他关注的还是工作，当他关上办公室门时，他可能想着他的爱情，但当他做到桌前时，他就会盯着那些印刷品和数字。

痛苦或欢乐都会分散一个人的爱。痛苦让人忘记一切，可以让人们暂时忘记爱情，甚至在受伤的时候也如此。食物所带来的欢乐完全吸引人，但甚至是来自爱的欢乐也会定期变得无聊。通常最大的分散者是自身。有时全神贯注，有时愁眉苦脸，有时积极向上，有时欢乐愉悦，这些都不会夹杂着其他想法。爱可能让人愉悦，但一个人无法不停歇地活着或爱着。充其量爱只能回荡在诗人（欧内斯特 的文森）的诗句中“我在心里对你依旧忠诚。”
