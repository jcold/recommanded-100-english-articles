Research in the field of language indicates that there are many things you can do to become a successful learner.Curiosity about language and culture, daily study, and the commitment to use English in every possible situationwhile in an English-speaking environment, are very important conditions for success.

1.Be clear and realistic about your goals. Your sense of success will depend on your needs for Englishand whether or not you meet your needs. It is not just a question of measured progress. If you need conversational fluency, notetaking skills will not meet your needs. If you must learn to write effective business letters, informal conversation with current slang will not help you achieve your goal.

Know what your goals are. Do you need English for occasional speaking situations,for travel or entertaining English-speaking visitors? Do you want to improve comprehension in both written and spoken English? Do you need to write English for professional purpose? Are you preparing for a university career in English? If so, your goals must include proficiency in all skill areas.

Learning a foreign language is an inexact process. Very few people learn to use a foreign language as wellas a native speaker does. Fortunately, very few people need to learn English like a native English speakerin every skill area. Be realistic and aware of your goals. There are many reasons to learn English, and your reasons are your own goals.

2.Be realistic about the length of time it takes to learn a language. Programs which promise overnight success are simply not being honest. Language learning is a cumulative process. You will experience bursts ofaccomplishment as well blocks and delays in progress. You will notice improvement at different speeds ineach skill area. Many students progress more quickly in passive skills (reading and grammar analysis) than in active and complex skills (speaking, notetaking during a lecture). If you are beginning level student whose goal is proficiency, a typical program may include at least nine months of intensive English study. Ifyour study program is short-term and your goals include improvement and review rather than proficiency youmay realise some progress in two or more weeks.

3.Be aware of your learning style. If you know that you learn more quickly when you listen to an English statement a few times before writing it, or if you know that seeing a picture or graphic representation of a word or expression helps you to remember the word, then develop study habits which use the most effective techniques for you. Excellent instructors who know that students must be involved in active learning will created active learning experiences to connect you with the language.

4.Learn something about “language learning”.Remember that language is a complex system of meaningful sounds organised with a series of rules (grammar). Every student has to study enough pronunciation, grammar and sentence structure to understand this! It is also true that language is a form of behaviour involving the human need to communicate and to be understood. Language learning involves motivation, emotion, a senseof self, and a set of cultural beliefs. Language is much more than sound and words and grammar. As you learn a new language, you will produce a “series of successive approximations”,meaning that each attempt ata new language will bring you closer to effective communication. Language learning requires that you make mistakes. Do not be afraid of a language or afraid of making errors. Develop an abiity to relax; “playing” with a new language is an important part of learning.

5.Take responsibility for your own learning. A good instructor is half the equation for successful language learning. Take charge of your learning; participate actively in your program. Look for opportunities to use your new language in any of many new environments. Be willing to make mistakes and learn from these mistakes. Focus on your goals, your study habits, and your willingness to “learn to learn”. Enjoy the process! Find inside yourself the reasons you want to learn, and determine ways to evaluate your success for yourself.

语言领域的研究显示，要想成为一个成功的学习者，你有许多事情可做。对于语言和文化的好奇、曰常学习以及处于 一个英语环境之中，自觉地在每个可能的场合中使用英语，这些都是迈向成功的重要条件。

1.目标明确而现实。成功的感觉依赖子你对英语的需要以及你是否满足了这些需要。这不仅仅是一个衡量学习进度的 问题。如果你想要流利地对话，笔记技巧不会满足你的需要。如果你一定要学会起草给人印象深刻的商务信函，非正式的、包含曰常悝语的对话不能帮你实现目标。

要知道你的目标是什么。你学英语是为了应付偶而的说话场合、用于旅行中还是为接待说英语的客人？你想在英语写作和口语的理解方面取得进步吗？你因为职业原因而需要用到英语写作吗？你正准备在大学谋求一份有关英语的职业吗？如果是这样，你的目标一定要包括精通英语的所有技能。

学习一门外语是一个非精确的过程。很少有人能学会和外国当地人一样使用英语。所幸的是，也很少有人需要像外国当地人一样学习英语的每一种技能。你的目标必须明确而现实。学英语的原因有许多，依据原因确定你自己的目标。

2.安排学习语言的时间长短要实亊求是。承诺一夜成功的培训纯厲无稽之谈。语言学习是一个不断积累的过程。在学 习进展中，你会突飞猛进，也会经历阻碍和拖延。对于每一种技能，你会发现进步的速度也不尽相同。许多学生在被动的技能 训练（阅读和语法分析）中进步更快，而在主动并且复杂的技能训练（说、记课堂笔记）中则进步较悛。如果你是初级阶段的学 生，你的目标是熟练，典型的培训则可能包括至少9个月的英语 强化学习。如果你的学习班是短期性质，你的目标是复习与提高，而不是熟练，你在两个或两个以上的星期内就能取得一些进步。

3.注意你的学习风格。如耒你觉得在多次倾听一个英语陈述后写下它将有助于你更快地把握它；或者如果你觉得通过观看某个单词或短语的图示能帮你加强记忆，那么你就要培养这些能帮助你最有效提高的良好学习习惯。深知学生需要主动投入学习的优秀老师，就会努力营造积极的学习实践，使你和语言紧紧联结在一起。

4.掌握学习语言的技巧。要记住，语言是一个按规则（语法）组织起来的具有意义的声音的复杂系统。每一个学生必须通过学习足够的发音、语法和句子结构知识来理解它。语言也是人类用来进行交流和表达自己的一种行为形式。语言学习包 括动机、情感、自我感觉和文化理念。语言的意义远不止于声音、词汇和语法。当你学习一门新语言时，你会产生一系列连续 性的共鸣，也就意味着，对一种新语言的每一次尝试，都会让你感觉距离有效交流更近一步。语言学习容许你犯错误，不要害 怕学习语言或者害怕犯错误。培养一种放松的心态，将学习融入乐趣，这在学习一门新的外语过程中是非常重要的。

5.对自己的学习负责。有好的老师就是语言学习成功的一半。要管理好自己的学习，积极参与你的培训课程。在任何可能的新环境中寻求使用新语言的机会。乐于犯错误并学会从这些错误中吸取教训；关注你的目标、你的学习习惯以及对“学会学习”的追求。享受这一过程吧！寻找你想要学习的内在动 因并为自己找出评价成功的方式。
