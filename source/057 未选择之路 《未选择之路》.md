美文原文

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not travel both

And be one traveler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better claim,

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

Though as for that the passing there

Had worn them really about the same,

And oth that morning equally lay

In leaves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for another day!

Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

[0Two roads diverged in a wood, and I

I took the one less traveled by,

And that has made all the difference.

美文翻译

从黄树林里分叉两条路，

只可惜我不能都踏行。

我，单独的旅人，伫立良久，

极目眺望一条路的尽头，

看它隐没在丛林深处。

于是我选择了另一条路，

一样平直,也许更值得，

因为青草茵茵，还未被踏过，

若有过往人踪，

路的状况会相差无几。

那天早晨，两条路都覆盖在枯叶下，没有践踏的污痕：

啊，原先那一条路留给另一天吧！

明知_条路会引出另一条路， 我怀疑我是否会回到原处。

在许多许多年以后，在某处，

我会轻轻叹息说：

黄树林里分叉两条路，而我——我选择了人迹较少的一条，

从而使得一切多么的不同。
