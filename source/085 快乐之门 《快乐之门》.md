美文原文

Happiness is like a pebble dropped into a pool to set in motion an ever-widening circle of ripples.As Stevenson has said, being happy is a duty.

There is no exact definition of the word happiness. Happy people are happy for all sorts of reasons.The key is not wealth or physical well-being, since we find beggars, invalids and so called failures who are extremely happy.

Being happy is a sort of unexpected dividend. But staying happy is an accomplishment,a triumph of soul andcharacter. It is not selfish to strive for it. It is, indeed, a duty to ourselves and others.

Being unhappy is like an infectious disease; it causes people to shrink away from the sufferer.He soon finds himself alone, miserable and embittered. There is, however, a cure so simple as to seem,at first glance,ridiculous: If you don’t feel happy, pretend to be!

It works. Before long you will find that instead of repelling people, you attract them. 

 You discover how deeply rewarding it is to be the center of wider and wider circles of good will.

Then the make-believe becomes a reality. You possess the secret of peace of mind, and can forget yourself in being of service to others.

Being happy, once it is realized as a duty and established as a habit,opens doors into unimaginable gardens thronged with grateful friends. 



美文翻译

快乐好似掷入池塘里的一枚鹅卵石,会激起不断扩散的一圈圈涟漪。正如斯蒂文生所说："快乐是一种责任。"

快乐这个字眼并没有确切的定义。快乐的人可以因种种理由而快乐。其关键并非在于财富或健康，因为我们可以发现有些乞丐、病弱的人和所谓的失败者却极其快乐。

快乐是一种意料不到的收益。而能保持快乐则是一项成就，也是灵魂与品性的胜利。努力追求快乐算不上是自私。事实上,追求快乐不仅是对我们自己，也是对别人的一种责任。

闷闷不乐就像是一种传染病；染上这种疾病的人大家都避之如蛇蝎。这种人很快就会发现自己感到孤单、痛苦和难过。然而,有一种很简单的治疗方法，乍看起来似乎荒谬可笑，那就是如果你觉得不快乐,就假装快乐吧！

这个方法很有效的。不久你就会发现自己非但不会使人反感,反而还能吸引别人。你会发现能够成为广结善缘的中心人物是多么值得的亊。
