美文原文

Self-control is essential to happiness and usefulness. It is the master of all the virtues,and has its root in self-respect. Let a man yield to his impulses and passions, and from that moment he gives up his moral freedom.

It is the self-discipline of a man that enables him to pursue success with superior diligence and sobriety.Many of the great characters in history illustrate this trait. In ordinary life the application is the same.He who would lead must first command himself. The time of test is when everybody is excited or angry,then the well-balanced mind comes to the front.

There is a very special demand for the cultivation of his trait at present.The young men who rush into business with no good education or drill will do poor and feverish work.Endurance is a much better test of character than act of heroism.

A fair amount of self-examination is good. Self-knowledge is a preface to self-control. Too much self-inspection leads to morbidness; too little conducts to careless and hasty action. There are two things which will surely strengthen our self-control. One is attention to conscience; the other is a spirit of good will.The man who would succeed in any great undertaking must hold all his faculties under perfect control; they must be disciplined and drilled until they quickly and cheerfully obey the will.

美文翻译

自制是幸福快乐与有所作为所不可或缺的。它主宰着一切美德，并根植于自尊之中。假若一个人屈服于其冲动突兀和感情用事，则从那一刻起他便放弃了他的道德自由。

正是自律使人能够更加勘奋和冷静地去追求成功。历史上的许多伟人都例证了这种特质。在曰常生活之中，自律的运用也同样如此。想要领导他人的人必须先要攀控自我。每个人激动或是生气的时候,考验的时刻便到了，这时心平气和的心态便应冲锋陷阵了。

目前是特别需要培养这种特质的时候。没有受过良好教育或训练的年轻人匆匆进入商界,做起事情来一定既差劲又毛踝。忍耐要比逞英雄更能考验人的品格。

适度的自我检讨是可取的。若有自知之明方可自我制约。过度的自我检讨会导致病态;检讨不足则会使得行亊粗心草率。不过,有两样东西肯定会增强我们的自制力。其一是注重良知，其二是心怀善意。不管一个人从事多么伟大的事业，要想成功就必须妥善掌控自己的才能；这些才能必须要先加以约束和磨炼，而后它们才会迅速而又令人愉快地服从人的意愿。
