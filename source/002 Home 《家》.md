美文原文

Home

What makes a home? Love and sympathy and confidence.

It is a place where kindly affections exist among all the members of the family. The parents take good care of their children, and the children are interested in the activities of their parents. Thus all of them are bound together by affection, and they find their home to be the cheeriest place in the world.

A home without love is no more a home than a body without a soul is a man. Every civilized person is a social being.No one should live alone. A man may lead a successful and prosperous life,but prosperity alone can by no means insure happiness.

Many great personages in the world history had deep affections for their homes. Your home may be poor and humble, but your duty lies there. You should try to make it cheerful and comfortable. The greater the difficulties, the richer will be your reward. A home is more than a family dwelling. It is a school in which people are trained for citizenship. A man will not render good service to his country if he can do nothing good for his home; for in proportion as he loves his home, will he love his country. The home is the birthplace of true patriotism. It is the secret of social welfare and national greatness. It is the basis and origin of civilization.

家

什么组成了家庭？是爱、同情和信心 。

在家里，所有的家庭成员都充满了爱意 。父母细心照顾自己的孩子，同时，孩子也全身心地投入到与父母的活动当中 。所有的家庭成员因为爱而连接在了一起，他们把家当做是世界上最温馨的地方 。

就像没有灵魂的身体，没有爱的家不再称之为家 。每一名有文化的人都是社会的一份子 。没有人会独自生活 。人们或许会拥有成功、富裕的人生，但是只有财富却不能够保证幸福 。

世界上的许多名人都对家庭有着深切的感情 。你的家可能会很贫穷，但是你却肩负重任 。你应该尝试着让它变得更加愉悦，变得更加舒适 。困难越大，你的收获也将越多 。家庭远远不只是家人栖息的场所 。家庭就像是一所学校，在里面的人们接受培训并成为公民 。如果一个人不能给家庭带来好处，那么他也将不会尽心尽力地的国家效力，如果他深爱他的家庭，那么他也将深爱他的国家 。家庭是爱国主义的诞生地 。家庭是社会福利和国家强盛的秘诀 。家庭也是文化的源泉 。
