美文原文

I was up the next morning before the October sunrise, and away through the wild and the woodland. The rising of the sun was noble in the cold and warmth of it; peeping down the spread of light, he raised his shoulder heavily over the edge of gray mountain and wavering length of upland. Beneath his gaze the dew-fogs dipped and crept to the hollow places, then stole away in line and column, holding skirts and clinging subtly at the sheltering corners where rock hung over grass-land, while the brave lines of the hills came forth, one beyond other gliding.

The woods arose in folds, like drapery of awakened mountains, stately with a depth of awe, and memory of the tempests. Autumn's mellow hand was upon them, as they owned already, touched with gold and red and olive, and their joy towards the sun was less to a bridegroom than a father. Yet before the floating impress of the woods could clear itself, suddenly the gladsome light leaped over hill and valley, casting amber, blue, and purple, and a tint of rich red rose, according to the scene they lit on, and the curtain flung around; yet all alike dispelling fear and the cloven hoof of darkness, all on the wings of hope advancing, and proclaiming, "God is here!" Then life and joy sprang reassured from every crouching hollow; every flower and bud and bird had a fluttering sense of them, and all the flashing of God's gaze merged into soft beneficence. So, perhaps, shall break upon us that eternal morning, when crag and chasm shall be no more, neither hill and valley, nor great unvintaged ocean; when glory shall not scare happiness, neither happiness envy glory; but all things shall arise, and shine in the light of the Father's countenance, because itself is risen.

美文翻译

十月日出前的一个早晨，我起身，穿过荒野和丛林。在十月的清晨，乍暖还寒之时，日出绚丽而高贵；他在苍老连绵的大山之巅用力地伸展着他的臂膀，划破那抹晨光。 在他的凝视之下，蒙蒙的雾气缓缓散落潜向谷底，继而丝丝缕缕地溜走，笼住峭壁，狡黠地隐匿于悬在草地之上的岩石中，随即群山的雄姿逐渐呈现，山峦也越发清晰。

树木层叠的出现，像苏醒的大山的帷幔一样，威武庄严，引起狂风暴雨的回忆。 秋用温柔的手抚摩着它们，像已拥有的那样，点缀着金色，红色和橄榄色，它们对朝阳所怀有的喜悦，像是奉献给一位新郎，更像是奉献给一位父亲。 然而就在树木模糊的形象即将清晰之前，突然那道令人愉悦的光芒跳过丘陵和山谷，依照他们停落的那一幕，射出了琥珀，蓝，紫以及华丽的玫瑰红，接着帘幕一甩， 所有的一切驱散了恐惧和黑暗中的邪恶，所有的一切都插上希望之翼开始前进，渐渐清晰，"上帝就在这里！" 生命和喜悦的出现使所有在低谷中蜷缩的充满信心，每朵花、每颗芽、每只鸟都在生命和喜悦之中悸动，所有上帝凝视的光芒都融入了温和的慈悲之中。 所以，或许，当峭壁和深渊，丘陵和山谷，浩瀚的但不古老的海洋不再有，当荣耀不会吓跑幸福，幸福也不再嫉妒荣耀的时候，那无边无尽的早晨才会被打破。 所有的一切都将升起，在上帝的面容呈现的光辉之中闪耀，因为它已升起。
