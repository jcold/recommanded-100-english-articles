美文原文

Each human being is born as something new, something that never existed before. Each is born with the capacity to win at life. Each person has a unique way of seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and thinking. Eachhas his or her own unique potentials - capabilities and limitations. Each can be a significant, thinking,aware, and creative being - a productive person, a winner.

The word “winner” and “loser” have many meanings. When we refer to a person as a winner, we do not mean one who makes someone else lose. To us, a winner is one who responds authentically by being credible, trustworthy, responsive, and genuine, both as an individual and as a member of a society.

maintaining pretence, and manipulating others. They are aware that there is a difference between being loving and acting loving, between being stupid and acting stupid, between being knowledgeable and acting knowledgeable. Winners do not need to hide behind a mask.

Winners are not afraid to do their own thinking and to use their own knowledge. They can separate facts from opinion and don’t pretend to have all the answers. They listen to others, evaluate what they say, but come to their own conclusions. Although winners can admire and respect other people, they are not totally defined, demolished, bound, or awed by them.

Winners do not play “helpless”, nor do they play the blaming game. Instead, they assume responsibility for their own lives. They do not give others a false authority over them. Winners are their own bosses and know it.

A winner’s timing is right. Winners respond appropriately to the situation. Their responses are related to the message sent and preserve the significance, worth, well-being, and dignity of the people involved. Winners know that for everything there is a season and for every activity a time.

Although winners can freely enjoy themselves, they can also postpone enjoyment, can discipline themselves in the present to enhance their enjoyment in the future. Winners are not afraid to go after what they want,but they do so in appropriate ways. Winners do not get their security by controlling others. They do not set themselves up to lose.

美文翻译

每个人生来就是新的亊物，是前所未有的亊物。每个人天生就具有在生话中获取成功的能力。毎个人都有自己观察、聆听、触摸、品尝和思考的独特方式。每个人也各有其独特潜能——各有所长也各有局限。每个人都有可能成为一个重要、好思考、头脑清醒而富于想像的人--一个创造性的人，一个贏家。

“贏家”一词和“输家”一词都有多种不同的含义。当我们认为某人为贏家，并不意味着他会让别人输掉什么。在我们看来，一个贏家不管是作为个体还是社会的一分子，他都会以可靠、诚信、感怀、坦率的态度真切地对一切作出反应。

贏家不会置身于想像他们应当成为何种人的观念之中；相反，他们就是本真的自我。因此，他们不会费神费力地装模作样,故作姿态，以及玩弄他人。他们很清楚爱与装爱、傻与装傻、真才实学与故作高深之间的区别。贏家们不需要用面具掩饰自己。

贏家们不惧怕进行独立思考和运用自身的知识。他们既能够区分事实与想法，又不会装作通晓一切。他们倾听他人意见，评估他人的言论，从而得出自己的结论。虽然贏家们能够敬佩和尊重他人，但是却不会完全被他人所限制、伤害、束缚或吓倒。

贏家们不会装作“无助”，也不会玩弄怨天尤人的把戏。相反，他们承担生活中自己应尽的责任。他们不会给别人名不符实的权威，让别人凌驾于他们之上。贏家们主宰着自己的命运，对此他们一清二楚。

贏家们擅于掌握时机，会对形势作出适当的应对。他们能 根据得到的佶息做出反应，维护有关人员的地位、价值、利益和尊严。贏家们知道，每件亊情都有其适宜的时机，每个行动都有其恰当的时刻。

虽然贏家们能自由自在地享受生活，但是他们也能推迟享乐的时间。他们能够在目前约束自己，以便在将来享受更大的快乐。贏家们不惧怕追求心中想要的东西，但是行为方式恰如其分。贏家们不会通过控制他人来获取自身的安全感。他们不会把自己推向失敗。
