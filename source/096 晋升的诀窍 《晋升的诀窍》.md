美文原文

A Chief Executive officer is not necessarily someone who has had a lot of formal training.So, I doubt moreschooling would help you climb up that ladder of success.

Maybe you should try and change your work habits or character. You cannot just sit around in an organization waiting for people to promote you. You have to let people know you are ambitious and waiting for biggerand more rewarding challenges. You should tell your supervisor or boss that you want to be promoted and rise up that management ladder. A good manager will accept, even respect the fact that you wish for career development. If this is not the case, you should find a new job or new company that will allow you to grow.

You must start out small. Hoping that one day you will suddenly become director of a company is doubtful. Getting ready for a slow ascent is more likely. Accept it, and commit yourself, realizing that it may be along climb.

You will need some skills to propel you up that ladder of success.You must be competent, that is you need to develop skills in many areas, such as marketing, human resources, public relations and finances.

You must also be a good people person, always cultivating relationships with the people around you.Having “guanxi” is a necessary characteristic of any successful CEO.

公司的首席执行官未必都是经过许多正规培训的人。所以，我认为接受更多的学校教育未必就能促使你在成功的阶梯上步步高升。

也许，你应该试着改变工作习惯或性格。不能仅仅在一个单位里坐等别人来提升你。必须让人们知道你胸怀大志，正在等待更大的、回报更多的挑战。应该告诉你的上司或老板：你想得到提拔，登上管理者的阶层。一位好经理将会理解，甚至尊重你发展亊业的愿望。假如情况不是这样的话，你就应该另谋髙就，以使自己得到发展。

必须从小处开始做起。幻想着有一天突然当上某公司的领导是不太现实的。作好准备慢慢地升迁，可能性更大。接受现实，全力以赴，要意识到这可能是一种漫长的攀登。

你需要掌握一些促使自己往上爬升的技能。你必须具备胜任工作的各种能力。换句话说，你必须具备诸如市场营销、人力资源、公关和财务等方面的技能。

你也必须要有良好的人缘，营造与周围的人黻洽的关系，好的"关系"是任何一位成功的首席执行官必备的要素。
