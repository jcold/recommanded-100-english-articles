美文原文

What is leadership? Its qualities are difficult to define.But they are not so difficult to identify.

Leaders don’t force other people to go along with them.They bring them along. Leaders get commitment fromothers by giving it themselves,by building an environment that encourages creativity, and by operating with honesty and fairness.

Leaders demand much of others, but also give much of themselves.They are ambitious - not only for themselves, but also for those who work with them.They seek to attract, retain and develop other people to their full abilities.

Good leaders aren’t “lone rangers”.They recognize that an organization’s strategies for success require the combined talents and efforts of many people.Leadership is the catalyst for transforming those talents into results.

Leaders know that when there are two opinions on an issue, one is not bound to be wrong.They recognize that hustle and rush are the allies of superficiality.They are open to new ideas, but they explore their ramifications thoroughly.

Successful leaders are emotionally and intellectually oriented to the future - not wedded to the past.Theyhave a hunger to take responsibility, to innovate, and to initiate.They are not content with merely takingcare of what’s already there.They want to move forward to create something new.

Leaders provide answers as well as direction, offer strenght as well as dedication,and speak from experience as well as understanding of the problems they face and the people they work with. 

 Leaders are flexible rather than dogmatic. They believe in unity rather than conformity.And they strive toachieve consensus out of conflict.

Leadership is all about getting people consistently to give their best,helping them to grow to their fullest potential, and motivating them to work toward a common good.Leaders make the right things happen when they’re supposed to.

A good leader, an effective leader, is one who has respect.Respect is something you have to have in order to get.A leader who has respect for other people at all levels of an organization, for the work they do,and for their abilities, aspirations and needs, will find that respect is returned.And all concerned will bemotivated to work together.

什么是领导？领导所应具备的品质很难精确界定。但是辨认指陈却并不困难。

领导者不会强制他人与自己保持协调一致。而是引导他们跟进。领导者要让别人承担义务，首先自己去承担，并创设一种能够鼓励创造的环境，为人处事诚恳而公正。

领导者对别人要求甚多，同时给予别人也很多。他们拥有 雄心壮志——不仅为自己，也为和他一起工作的人。他们想方 设法吸引人才，留住他们，力求人尽其才。

好的领导者不是“独行侠"。他们认识到一个组织要获取成功，其方针在于将许多人的才能和力量联结起来。领导艺术 是一种催化剂，将众人的才智转化为业绩。

领导者明白，在争论的问题上出现两种意见的时候，并非必然有一种是错误的。他们认识到匆忙草率就会导致肤浅片面。他们对新的设想或建议敞幵心胸，但是对于其细节和后果要做 精细的探讨。

成功的领导者无论是在情感上还是理智上都着眼子未来而不沉迷于过去。他们渴望肩负责任、锐意改革和积极开拓。他们不会满足于仅仅守成。他们要向前进取，要创造新事物。

领导者不但给予他人方向性指导，也对问题和要求提供具体解答，不仅示以献身的精神，而且给予行事的力量。

他们说话既根据以往的经验。也根据对问题的认识以及对同事的了解。领导者处事灵活而不武断。

他们认为与其循规蹈矩不如协调一致，而且他们力求在矛盾冲突中求得意见的统一。领导艺术全然在于使下级工作人员不断地发挥所长，

帮助他们最大限度地发掘潜力，推动他们为共同的事业而工作。领导者务必使该办的事情按时完成。一个好的领导者，卓有成效的领导者，善于对人关怀尊重，要得到别人的尊重必须首先尊重别人，领导者对本组织各级人 员都会示以尊重，对他们的工作、能力、愿望与需求示以关怀，而 他也会发现人家也尊重他关怀他。这样，所有有关人员就都会被激励起来而共同努力工作。
