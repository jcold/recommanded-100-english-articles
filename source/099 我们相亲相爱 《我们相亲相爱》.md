美文原文

Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away.

And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sign.

O Troupe of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints in my words.

The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover.

It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal.

It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom.

The mighty desert is burning for the love of a blade of grass who shakes her head and laughs and flies away.

If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars.

The sands in your way beg for your song and your movement, dancing water. Will you carry the burden of their lameness?

Her wishful face haunts my dreams like the rain at night.

Once we dreamt that we were strangers.

We wake up to find that we were dear to each other.

美文翻译

夏天的飞鸟，飞到我的宙前唱歌，又飞去了。

秋天的黄叶，它们没有什么可唱，只叹息一声，飞落在那里。

世界上的一队小小的漂泊者呀，请留下你们的足印在我的文字里。

世界对着它的爱人，把它浩翰的面具揭下了。

它变小了，小如一首歌，小如一回永恒的接吻。

是大地的泪点，使她的微笑保持着裔春不谢。

无垠的沙漠热烈追求一叶绿草的爱，她摇摇头笑着飞开了。如果你因失去了太阳而流泪，那么你也将失去群星了。

跳舞着的流水呀，在你途中的泥沙，要求你的歌声，你的流动呢。你肯挟癀足的泥沙而俱下么？

她的热切的脸，如夜雨似的，搅扰着我的梦魂。

有一次，我们梦见大家都是不相识的。

我们醒了，却知道我们原是相亲相爱的。
