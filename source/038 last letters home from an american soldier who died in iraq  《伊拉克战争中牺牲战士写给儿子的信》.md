美文原文

To son, Cecil,

Just a quick note preface before I start in earnest. When I wrote this you were 8, still a little boy. In 2002, I was called to active duty in the Marine Corps in the War on Terrorism. On the 11th of September 2001 when America was attacked, I knew that I would eventually have to go and I was filled with a deep senseof sadness. That night as you and Keiko were asleep, I looked at your little faces and couldn’t help but fight the tears. I knew it would be hard for you because I had a similar experience. When I was a little boy aged 6, my Dad, your Grandpa Cawley, was sent to Vietnam during the War there. I remember how much I missed him, too. But now unfortunately I have come to realise just how rough it must have been for Grandpa to be away from his children for a year. Thinking about this, I wanted to put my thoughts and feelings downfor you and your sister. I am so sorry that I had to leave for such a long time. There is no place I wouldrather be than with you and Keiko. You two are the lights of my life. I have known no greater joy than in the few years since you two were born. I hope to have many more years with you. If this doesn’t happen, then know that I love you more than words can express. If for some reason I don’t make it home, I will need you to take care of your little sister and your Mom. You will be the Man of the Cawley family. Be good my son and God will watch over you as he has me. I will be waiting impatiently for the time when we can allbe together again.

All my love, Dad

(Two days after Cawley’s death, his last letter arrived at his family’s home in Utah. Written on the packaging of an MRE Meal Ready to Eat, the US military’s frontline ration it consisted of a message in Japanese to his wife and his final words to his children.)

Dear Cecil and Keiko,

Hi little guys. How are you? Daddy is fine. I miss you. Send me a letter okay. It will make me very happy.I am proud of you. You are such good kids. I will see you again.

Love, Daddy -

给儿子塞西尔：

在正式开始前先简单说几句。 当我写这封信的时候，你才8岁，还是一个小男孩。2002年，我被征召在海军陆战队服现役，参加反恐战争。2001年9月11日美国遭受袭击之时，我便知道我终究是要走的，我为此感到深深的悲哀。那天晚上，当你和惠子熟睡之际，我看着你们的小脸蛋，强忍着眼中的泪水。我知道接下来的日子对你们会是艰难的，因为我也有过类似的经历。当我还是一个6岁的孩子的时候，我爸爸，也就是你们的爷爷考利，被派往越南参加那里的战争。我还记得当时我也是多么地想念他。然而不幸的是，现在我开始体会到，你爷爷离开自己的孩子们一年之久，该是多么痛苦的事情。想到这些，我打算把我的想法和感受给你和你妹妹写下来。我非常难过不得不离开这么长时间。除了与你和惠子在一起，我哪儿也不愿去。你们俩是我生命中的光芒。你们俩来到这个世界后的这几年，是我生命中最快乐的时光。我希望还可以和你们一起度过更多的岁月。如果事情没能如此，我希望你们知道我对你们的爱无法言传。如果因故我不能再回到家里，我需要你来照顾你妹妹和妈妈。你将是考利家族的男人。乖一点，我的孩子，如果上帝将我收回，他会照看你的。我会焦急地等待着我们全家重聚的那一天。

我全部的爱， 爸爸 



(在考利阵亡后2天，他最后的家书到达了他在犹他州的家。信是写在美军前线士兵配给的快餐包装纸上的。信中有用日文写给妻子的留言，以及给孩子们的绝笔。)

亲爱的塞西尔和惠子：

嗨，小家伙们。你们好吗？爸爸很好。我想念你们。给我来封信好吗？那会让我非常开心的。我为你们而自豪。你们都是这么好的孩子。我会与你们重聚的。

爱你们的爸爸
