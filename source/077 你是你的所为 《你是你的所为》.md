美文原文

If the past has taught us anything, it is that every cause brings effect - every action has a consequence.This thought, in my opinion, is the moral foundation of the universe; it applies equally in this world andthe next.

We Chinese have a saying: “If a man plants melons, he will reap melons; if he sows beans, he will reap beans.”And this is true of every man’s life: good begets good, and evil leads to evil.

True enough, the sun shines on the saint and sinner alike, and too often it seems that the wicked wax and prosper.But we can say with certitude that, with the individual as with the nation,the flourishing of the wicked is an illusion, for, unceasingly, life keeps books on us all.

In the end, we are all the sum total of our actions. Character cannot be counterfeited,nor can it be put on and cast off as if it were a garment to meet the whim of the moment.Like the markings on wood which are ingrained in the very heart of the tree,character requires time and nurture for growth and development.

Thus also, day by day, we write our own destiny, for inexorably we become what we do.This, I believe, is the supreme logic and the law of life.

美文翻译

假如说过去的日子曾经教给我们一些什么的话，那就是有因必有果——每一个行为都有一种结果。在我看来，这种想法是全宇宙的道徳基础；它不仅适用于今生，也适用于来世。

我们中国人有一句俗语说："种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。"而这就是每个人生活的真实写照：善有善报，恶有恶报。

说实在话，圣人与罪人皆会受到阳光的披泽，而且常常似乎是恶者大行其道。但是我们可以确信地说，不管是对个人或是对国家而言，恶人猖撅只是一种幻象，因为生活无时无刻不在将我们的所作所为像账本一样一笔一笔记录下来。

最终,我们就是我们行为的总和。品性是无法伪装的，也无法像衣服一样随兴地穿上或脱下来丢在一旁。就像木头的纹路发端于树木深邃的中心，品性的生长与发育也需要时间和滋养。

也因此，我们日复一日地写下我们自身的命运，因为我们的所作所为毫不留情地决定着我们的命运。我坚信，这就是人生的最高逻辑和法则。
